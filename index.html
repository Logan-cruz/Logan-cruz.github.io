    <h3>Esports For York Tech.</h3>
    <p> York Tech School Of Technology's esports did not exist the first year I was there. It was made during my
      sophmore
      year, in 2021-2022. I was one of few who joined both Mario Kart and Smash Bros Ultimate. In that first year, we
      all had to learn which character we wanted to learn, and dedicate free time so we can learn more of our character.
      Our second yea however, Those remain taught the ones who joined, and now we had student leadership, which was
      Student Coach, And Student Team Leader. I wasn't one during my sophmore year, I still had much to learn before
      I could lead and help a team myself, but in my junior year, i became a Team Captain. It was a lot at first,
      having the team look up at you for advice and answers. But you are not perfect. But you can try the best you can.
      That year, my team was 8th in the east coast of America. The furthest any team in Esports has gone before.
      It was leadership, cooperation, and teamwork from team that got me there, and i do hope they get further and
      further until we win.

    <h3>William Penn Marching Band.</h3>
    <p>I joined the William Penn Marching Band during my freshman year of York Tech School Of Technology, and during
      Covid. It was challenging during the first year, due to the fact that we had to social distance even during
      preformaces, and we had no realy instructor to teach us how to play the music. That year was the most difficult,
      due to being very independent on my learning while learning other spots so i didn't bump into them, but it was the
      most important year for me, to decide if i wanted to continue or not. The Second and
      Third year was much easier than he first year, because we had structure, section leaders who cared about wha
